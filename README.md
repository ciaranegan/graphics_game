# Graphcs Module Game
A game built using OpenGL for a graphics module I took.

Run 'make' in the directory. When compiled, run the './run_game' executable.

The aim of the game is to guide the green ball to the corner of the board with the blue arrow hovering above while avoiding the red balls. Arrow keys move the ball. W and D keys rotate the camera viewing angle.
